## Background

For this project, the team will demonstrate their skills acquired to date in regards to obtaining, cleaning, organizing, and publishing data with the additional challenge of incorporating machine learning to develop a website.  The intent of the website is to help future data analysts learn where potential career opportunities may be for them.

After reviewing the dataset, several columns would not be required and those were dropped from the csv along with any nulls.  The csv still contained over 1800 data points which was sufficient for the intent of the project.
